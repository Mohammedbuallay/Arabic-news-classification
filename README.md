Arabic news classification 

# Introduction
In this project we Collect Arabic Sentence and Tried to make a Arabic word Embedding, as a result I tried to build Arabic news classification.Arabic news classification is a webapp that detects news type in arabic language, trained in 4 different algorithms SVM, Naive Bayes, CNN and RNN. The Project was aimed to study the difference between them.
